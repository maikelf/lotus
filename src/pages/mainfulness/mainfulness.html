    <p>Mindfulness is our fundamental human ability to be fully present, conscious of where we are and what we’re doing. It is the ability to not be overly reactive or overwhelmed by what’s going on around us.</p>
    <p>Although we are inherently mindful, we become ever more present when we practice mindfulness on a daily basis.</p>
    <p>Mindfulness transcends any form of religion, it is simply a tool to exercise your brain&#39;s capacity to respond accordingly to the external world, as opposed to reacting to it.</p>
    <p>There is growing research indicating that when you train your brain to be mindful, you are physically re-modelling the structure of your brain.</p> 
    <p>At THL we strive to help bring direct awareness to what you are experiencing via your senses from a balanced state of mind by calibrating your thoughts and emotions.</p>  
    <p>Please take the time to use the Insight Timer App (make sure the title is clickable so they go to it from there as well) it will greatly compliment your lifestyle goals.</p>  
    <p>
      What we think, we BECOME!
