          The Healing Lotus App is a clinical tool for both
          healthcare professionals and their clients.
          • It is a compilation of manual self care techniques,
          rehabilitative exercises and stretches for increased
          flexibility &amp; mobility.
      </li>
      <li>
          The aim is to visually educate &amp; support our
          clients for a positive &amp; effective rehabilitative
          outcome.
      </li>
      <li>
          Using the app is very simple &amp; interactive. You
          will be able to search grossly by body region or by
          viewing common broad conditions.
      </li>
      <li>
          Due to The Healing Lotus&#39; holistic philosophy,
          you will also find helpful links to some of our
          favourite health tools, e.g. Insight Timer
          (mindfulness app).
      </li>
      <li>
          Professionals can create personal routines for
          their clients and select multiple videos from
          different categories. Sections for additional notes /
          instructions is also available alongside each
          exercise allowing for greater communication &amp;
          understanding between therapists &amp; clients.
      </li>
      <li>
          PDF Charts / Blank pages can be created to track
          client progress over the course of a rehabilitation
          program. These files can also be downloaded &amp;
          exported from the app to be uploaded / printed for
          storage in the clients file.
